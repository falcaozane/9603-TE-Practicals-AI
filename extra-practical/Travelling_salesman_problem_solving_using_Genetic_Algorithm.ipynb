        "\n",
        "This code implements a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem, which involves finding the shortest possible path that visits each city in a given set.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code starts by importing the necessary modules, which are random for generating random numbers and numpy for performing numerical operations on arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, the code defines a cities array that contains the coordinates of each city, and several genetic algorithm parameters, including the population_size, num_generations, and mutation_rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the code defines the calculate_fitness function, which takes an individual (i.e., a sequence of city indices) and the cities array as inputs and returns the fitness of the individual. The fitness is defined as the inverse of the total distance traveled by the individual, calculated as the sum of the distances between adjacent cities in the individual.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code also defines the selection function, which takes a population of individuals as input and performs selection by computing the fitness values of each individual, normalizing them to probabilities, and selecting population_size individuals from the population based on their probabilities. The function returns the selected individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The crossover function takes two parents and returns two children produced by randomly selecting a crossover point and exchanging the cities beyond that point between the parents.\n",
        "\n",
        "The mutation function takes an individual as input and randomly swaps the positions of two cities in the individual with probability mutation_rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main genetic algorithm loop starts by generating an initial population of individuals by randomly shuffling the indices of the cities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, for each generation, the selection function is called to select the most fit individuals from the population. The crossover and mutation functions are then applied to the selected individuals to create new offspring, which are added to the offspring list. Finally, the population is updated to be the offspring, and the loop repeats for the next generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "After all generations have been processed, the code finds the best individual (i.e., the individual with the highest fitness) in the final population using the max function with a lambda function that calculates the fitness of each individual. The code then calculates the distance traveled by the best individual and prints the sequence of city indices and the distance."
