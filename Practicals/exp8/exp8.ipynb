It takes an integer N as input, which represents the size of the chessboard, and returns a solution in the form of a list of coordinates (X,Y) representing the position of each queen on the board. The Solution variable is initially uninstantiated and will be bound to a solution by the predicate.\n",

The findall predicate takes three arguments: the first argument is a template for the solution (in this case, the uninstantiated Solution variable), the second argument is the goal to be satisfied (in this case, the safe predicate with Solution as its argument), and the third argument is the resulting list of solutions. This line generates a list of all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem.\n",

        "\n",
        "The safe predicate is the heart of the program. It checks whether a given solution is valid by ensuring that no two queens threaten each other. The safe predicate takes a list of coordinates as input and checks whether each queen is safe by checking whether it shares a row, column, or diagonal with any other queen in the list. The safe predicate is called recursively for each queen in the list, with the tail of the list passed as the argument.\n",

If the current queen is safe, the predicate is called recursively on the tail of the list.\n",
