Post Lab Assignment:
1. What is the relationship between tic-tac-toe and magic square?
If you consider a 3x3 magic square, where each cell holds a number such that all rows,
columns, and diagonals add up to the same magic number (usually 15), you can overlay a 
tic-tac-toe grid on top. Interestingly, a winning move in tic-tac-toe often corresponds to
filling in squares that sum up to the magic number.


2. What is a magic square of order n?
A magic square of order n is an n x n grid where each cell contains a different positive 
integer from 1 to n^2, and the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same, 
known as the magic constant. This constant can be calculated as:
Magic constant = n * (n^2 + 1) / 2
So, for a 3x3 magic square, the magic constant is 15
